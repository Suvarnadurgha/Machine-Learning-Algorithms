Machine Learning Algorithms using Python 

Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented:
Logistic Regression (baseline model)
MLP Classifier (Multi-Layer Perceptron) from Scikit-learn
Neural Network using TensorFlow and Keras

Dataset
Training Data: credit_training.csv – contains customer information and credit risk labels (RESPONSE).
Testing Data: credit_testing.csv – contains customer information without labels; the goal is to predict credit risk for these entries.
Features:

The dataset includes multiple features like:
CHK_ACCT: Checking account status
DURATION: Loan duration
HISTORY: Credit history
Other features such as car loans, furniture loans, and education levels.

Target Variable:
RESPONSE: Binary classification (0 = low risk, 1 = high risk)
